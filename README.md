# DailyWordWidget

Widgets have become super helpfull, but I couldn't find the one that I needed. So i created my own. 

The widget contains a Kanji character (Character from the Japanese alphabet), it's translation and pronounciation.

The character changes every day, so you learn a new character every time you start up your pc. Plus it look nice on your desktop.

The Kanji alphabet contains more than 10.000 characters, so don't worry about getting the same character multiple times.

I hope you enjoy it and are ready to learn some more Japanese!
